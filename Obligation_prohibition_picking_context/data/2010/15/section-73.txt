73 Maternity equality clause (1) If the terms of the woman's work do not (by whatever means) include a maternity equality clause, they are to be treated as including one. (2) A maternity equality clause is a provision that, in relation to the terms of the woman's work, has the effect referred to in section 74(1), (6) and (8). (3) In the case of a term relating to membership of or rights under an occupational pension scheme, a maternity equality clause has only such effect as a maternity equality rule would have.
