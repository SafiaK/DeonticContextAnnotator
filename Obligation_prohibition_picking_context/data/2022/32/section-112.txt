(2) The chief officer of police issuing a registration certificate must cause it to be sent to the designated officer for the local justice area in which the offender appears to the chief officer to reside. (3) The designated officer for a local justice area in receipt of a registration certificate must— (a) register the amount for enforcement as a fine in that area by entering it in the register of a magistrates’ court acting for that area, or (b) if it appears to the designated officer that the offender does not reside in that area, cause the certificate to be sent to the person appearing to the officer to be the designated officer for the local justice area in which the offender resides. (4) A designated officer registering an amount under this section for enforcement as a fine must give the offender notice of the registration which— (a) specifies the amount registered, and (b) gives the information with respect to the financial penalty, and the authority for registration, that was included in the registration certificate. (5) If an amount is registered in a magistrates’ court as a result of this section, any enactment referring (in whatever terms) to a fine imposed, or other sum adjudged to be paid, on conviction by such a court applies as if the registered amount were a fine imposed by that court on the conviction of the offender on the date on which the amount was registered.
