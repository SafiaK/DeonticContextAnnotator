(3) But this section does not impose duties on a driver in a case in which— (a) the taxi or private hire vehicle is designated, and (b) the disabled person is in a wheelchair. For provision that applies in such a case, see section 165.

(6) For the purposes of this section “ mobility aids ” means any item the passenger uses to assist with their mobility but does not include— (a) a wheelchair, or (b) an assistance dog (sections 168 and 170 make provision about the carrying of assistance dogs). (7) For the purposes of this section “ mobility assistance ” means assistance— (a) to enable the passenger to get into or out of the vehicle; (b) to load the passenger’s luggage, wheelchair or mobility aids into or out of the vehicle. (8) This section does not require the driver— (a) unless the vehicle is of a description prescribed by the Secretary of State, to carry more than one wheelchair on any one journey; (b) to carry a person in circumstances in which it would otherwise be lawful for the driver to refuse to carry the person. (9) The driver of a taxi or private hire vehicle commits an offence by failing to comply with a duty imposed on the driver by this section. (10) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (9) is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale. (11) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (9) in relation to the duty mentioned in subsection (5)(a) or (d) to show that at the time of the alleged offence the person could not reasonably have known that the passenger was disabled. (12) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (9) in relation to the duty mentioned in subsection (5)(b) or (c) to show that at the time of the alleged offence— (a) it would not have been possible for the wheelchair or mobility aids to be carried safely in the vehicle, or (b) it would not otherwise have been reasonable in all the circumstances for the wheelchair or mobility aids to be carried in the vehicle. (13) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (9) in relation to the duty mentioned in subsection (5)(e) to show that at the time of the alleged offence the person could not reasonably have known that the passenger required mobility assistance of the type required by the passenger.
