(4) In deciding whether to make a reduction order, the court must, in particular, take into account any evidence— (a) that the relevant young offender’s rehabilitation has been exceptional; (b) that the continued detention or imprisonment of the offender for the remainder of the minimum term is likely to give rise to a serious risk to the welfare or continued rehabilitation of the offender which cannot be eliminated or mitigated to a significant degree.
