(3) An exemption certificate is valid— (a) in respect of a specified private hire vehicle or a specified kind of private hire vehicle; (b) for such period as is specified in the certificate. (4) A driver does not commit an offence under section 170(3) if— (a) an exemption certificate issued to the driver is in force with respect to the private hire vehicle, and (b) the prescribed notice of the exemption is exhibited on the vehicle in the prescribed manner. The power to make regulations under paragraph (b) is exercisable by the Secretary of State. (5) In this section  “ driver ” and “licensing authority” have the same meaning as in section 170.
