210 The Scottish Ministers (1) This section applies where the power to make an order, regulations or rules under this Act is exercisable by the Scottish Ministers. (2) A statutory instrument containing (whether alone or with other provision) an order or regulations mentioned in subsection (3) is subject to the affirmative procedure. (3) The orders and regulations referred to in subsection (2) are— (a) regulations under section 2 (socio-economic inequalities); (b) regulations under section 37 (power to make provision about adjustments to common parts in Scotland); (c) an order under section 151 (power to amend list of public authorities for the purposes of the public sector equality duty); (d) regulations under section 153 or 154(2) (public sector equality duty: powers to impose specific duties); (e) regulations under section 155(5) that amend an Act of Parliament or an Act of the Scottish Parliament (public sector equality duty: power to modify or remove specific duties). (4) But a statutory instrument is not subject to the affirmative procedure by virtue of subsection (2) merely because it contains an order under section 151 that provides for— (a) the omission of an entry where the authority concerned has ceased to exist, or (b) the variation of an entry where the authority concerned has changed its name. (5) A statutory instrument that is not subject to the affirmative procedure by virtue of subsection (2) is subject to the negative procedure. (6) If a statutory instrument is subject to the affirmative procedure, the order or regulations contained in it must not be made unless a draft of the instrument is laid before and approved by a resolution of the Scottish Parliament. (7) If a statutory instrument is subject to the negative procedure, it is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the Scottish Parliament.
