108 Relationships that have ended (1) A person (A) must not discriminate against another (B) if— (a) the discrimination arises out of and is closely connected to a relationship which used to exist between them, and (b) conduct of a description constituting the discrimination would, if it occurred during the relationship, contravene this Act. (2) A person (A) must not harass another (B) if— (a) the harassment arises out of and is closely connected to a relationship which used to exist between them, and (b) conduct of a description constituting the harassment would, if it occurred during the relationship, contravene this Act. (3) It does not matter whether the relationship ends before or after the commencement of this section. (4) A duty to make reasonable adjustments applies to A if B is placed at a substantial disadvantage as mentioned in section 20. (5) For the purposes of subsection (4), sections 20, 21 and 22 and the applicable Schedules are to be construed as if the relationship had not ended. (6) For the purposes of Part 9 (enforcement), a contravention of this section relates to the Part of this Act that would have been contravened if the relationship had not ended. (7) But conduct is not a contravention of this section in so far as it also amounts to victimisation of B by A.
