(2) A person does not contravene section 29, so far as relating to sex discrimination, by providing separate services differently for persons of each sex if— (a) a joint service for persons of both sexes would be less effective, (b) the extent to which the service is required by one sex makes it not reasonably practicable to provide the service otherwise than as a separate service provided differently for each sex, and (c) the limited provision is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. (3) This paragraph applies to a person exercising a public function in relation to the provision of a service as it applies to the person providing the service.

(4) The condition is that— (a) a joint service for persons of both sexes would be less effective, and (b) the extent to which the service is required by persons of each sex makes it not reasonably practicable to provide separate services.

(6) The condition is that— (a) the service is provided for, or is likely to be used by, two or more persons at the same time, and (b) the circumstances are such that a person of one sex might reasonably object to the presence of a person of the opposite sex.
