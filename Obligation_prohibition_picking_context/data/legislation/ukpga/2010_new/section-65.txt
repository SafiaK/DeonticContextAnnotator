65 Equal work (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, A's work is equal to that of B if it is— (a) like B's work, (b) rated as equivalent to B's work, or (c) of equal value to B's work. (2) A's work is like B's work if— (a) A's work and B's work are the same or broadly similar, and (b) such differences as there are between their work are not of practical importance in relation to the terms of their work. (3) So on a comparison of one person's work with another's for the purposes of subsection (2), it is necessary to have regard to— (a) the frequency with which differences between their work occur in practice, and (b) the nature and extent of the differences. (4) A's work is rated as equivalent to B's work if a job evaluation study— (a) gives an equal value to A's job and B's job in terms of the demands made on a worker, or (b) would give an equal value to A's job and B's job in those terms were the evaluation not made on a sex-specific system. (5) A system is sex-specific if, for the purposes of one or more of the demands made on a worker, it sets values for men different from those it sets for women. (6) A's work is of equal value to B's work if it is— (a) neither like B's work nor rated as equivalent to B's work, but (b) nevertheless equal to B's work in terms of the demands made on A by reference to factors such as effort, skill and decision-making.
