- Required Python packages:
  - requests
  - Other dependencies (to be listed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The annotation process is initiated through `pipeline.py`. This script:

1. Accepts a legislation act URL
2. Downloads the act
3. Processes and converts the style according to the tool's requirements
4. Creates a deployment package with:
   - index.html (or index_with_selection.html for new style)
   - Required styles
   - Processed act files
   - Necessary scripts

### Running the Pipeline

```bash
python pipeline.py
```

The script will:
1. Download the specified legislation act
2. Process the act for annotation
3. Create a deployment package
4. Generate a zip file containing all necessary files

## Annotation Styles

### Old Style
- Basic annotation without section marking
- Uses `index.html` as the main interface
- Simpler annotation process

### New Style
- Advanced annotation with section selection
- Uses `index_with_selection.html` as the main interface
- Includes section marking functionality
- More detailed annotation capabilities

## Project Structure

- `pipeline.py`: Main entry point for the annotation process
- `index.html`: Interface for old annotation style
- `index_with_selection.html`: Interface for new annotation style

- `styles/`: CSS files for styling the interface
- `processed_acts/`: Contains processed legislative texts
